# F-Droid
WmeLuna's repo, just a collection of mods/apps that I use/recommend   
Most apps auto-update in the repo, which happens every 24 hours or when I manually run the update script I have made   
Recommendations for new apps/mods welcomed, create an [issue](https://github.com/WmeLuna/fdroid/issues/new/choose) with the name and if possible the github repo
